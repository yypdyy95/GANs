Variational Autoencoders
===
Here are two different types of Autoencoders presented:

# 1. Variational Autoencoder
This model samples latent variables to generate images which have similar features as the original data set.

# 2. Conditional Variational Autoencoder
This model samples latent variables to generate images which have similar features as the original data set. Furthermore, there is an additional input which gives information about the class labels of the image. Hereby, it is possible to generate images which show distinct features with just one model.
